# Chromium with SSL VPN

Chromium is the open source project behind the Google Chrome browser. It is a fully functional browser and also widely used by other parties to create their own browsers. Many vendors use the code in a similar manner as Google, while others simply build it as-is and release browsers with the Chromium name.

This build takes advantage of the [VPN](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/vpnProvider) and [Proxy](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/proxy) API developed by Google. 

You can use this browser to surf the Internet securely and privately. All your traffic will be encrypted and sent through anonymous proxy servers.
