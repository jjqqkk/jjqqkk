## About Chromium

Chromium is Google's open-source web browser project. It is a fully functional browser on its own and supplies the vast majority of code for the Google Chrome browser.

The Chromium code is also widely used by other parties to create their own browsers. Many vendors use the code in a similar manner as Google, while others simply build it as-is and release browsers with the Chromium name.

If you would like to install Chromium manually, get the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jjqqkk/chromium/releases).
